# Sonic 1: The Special Stages

An old romhack from 2012, focusing the gameplay on the Sonic 1 special stages.

So I decided to make this open source. Feel free to fork this and experiment with it or continue work on it.
Please give credit, where credit is due, unless you remove certain parts to which people have contributed to.


# Credits:

- vladikcomper: For creating the main menu and info screen
- MarkeyJester: For helping me fixing some bugs I couldn't fix

I am confident that more people helped me on this, but it's been 10 years since I last touched this. If you helped me in some way, feel free to let me know on the Sonic Retro thread.


Enjoy!
